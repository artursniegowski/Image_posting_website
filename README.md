# Image_posting_website

This is a responsive website that works like a blog where anyone can post an image and a short description of it. After adding it, the picture will be displayed with the text and date added on the website in a chronological order (starting from the most recent). A successful post will be indicated with a short Django message that will be visible only the first time someone views the home page. All the media files are stored and managed by Django as static files. This solution needs to be adjusted in order to work in production.


Created with Django 4.1, sorl-thumbnail, Python 3.10.6 and Bootstrap 5.
